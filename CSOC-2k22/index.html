          <h2>What is the importance of Agricuture..?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="morecontent">
          <p>
            Agriculture plays a vital role in the Indian economy. Over 70 per
            cent of the rural households depend on agriculture. Agriculture is
            an important sector of Indian economy as it contributes about 17% to
            the total GDP and provides employment to around 58% of the
            population. Indian agriculture has registered impressive growth over
            last few decades. The foodgrains production has increased from 51
            million tonnes (MT) in 1950-51 to 250MT during 2011-12 highest ever
            since independence.
          </p>
          <img class="img1" src="images/farm4.jpg" alt="planting crops" />

          <p>Agricultural influence on national income:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The contribution of agriculture during the first two decades
              towards the gross domestic product ranged between 48 and 60%. In
              the year 2001-2002, this contribution declined to only about 26%.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Agriculture plays vital role in generating employment:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In India at least two-thirds of the working population earn their
              living through agricultural works. In India other sectors have
              failed generate much of employment opportunity the growing working
              populations.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Agriculture makes provision for food for the ever increasing
            population:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Due to the excessive pressure of population labour surplus
              economies like India and rapid increase in the demand for food,
              food production increases at a fast rate. The existing levels of
              food consumption in these countries are very low and with a little
              increase in the capita income, the demand for food rise steeply
              (in other words it can be stated that the income elasticity of
              demand for food is very high in developing countries).
            </li>
            <li>
              Therefore, unless agriculture is able to continuously increase it
              marketed surplus of food grains, a crisis is like to emerge. Many
              developing countries are passing through this phase and in a bid
              to make the increasing food requirements agriculture has been
              developed.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Contribution to capital formation:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              There is general agreement on the necessity capital formation.
              Since agriculture happens be the largest industry in developing
              country like India, it can and must play an important role in
              pushing up the rate of capital formation. If it fails to do so,
              the whole process economic development will suffer a setback.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Supply of raw material to agro-based industries:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Agriculture supplies raw materials to various agro-based
              industries like sugar, jute, cotton textile and Vanaspati
              industries. Food processing industries are similarly dependent on
              agriculture. Therefore, the development of these industries
              entirely is dependent on agriculture.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Market for industrial products:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Increase in rural purchasing power is very necessary for
              industrial development as two- thirds of Indian population live in
              villages. After green revolution the purchasing power of the large
              farmers increased due to their enhanced income and negligible tax
              burden.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Influence on internal and external trade and commerce:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Indian agriculture plays a vital role in internal and external
              trade of the country. Internal trade in food-grains and other
              agricultural products helps in the expansion of service sector.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Contribution in government budget:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Right from the First Five Year Plan agriculture is considered as
              the prime revenue collecting sector for the both central and state
              budgets. However, the governments earn huge revenue from
              agriculture and its allied activities like cattle rearing, animal
              husbandry, poultry farming, fishing etc. Indian railway along with
              the state transport system also earn a handsome revenue as freight
              charges for agricultural products, both-semi finished and finished
              ones.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Need of labour force:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A large number of skilled and unskilled labourers are required for
              the construction works and in other fields. This labour is
              supplied by Indian agriculture.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Greater competitive advantages:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Indian agriculture has a cost advantage in several agricultural
              commodities in the export sector because of low labour costs and
              self- sufficiency in input supply.

          <h2>Significance of farmers in economy...</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="extracontent">
          <p>
            Now I am going to discuss the importance of farmer in the future
            generations. According to world's survey our India is one of the top
            countries in cultivation and farming. But now -a -days Indian
            farmers stayed a neglected community for decades despite their huge
            contribution in economy of the Nation. Indian farmers are the
            backbones of our nation's economy as Indian economy is primarily
            Agriculture based country. Statics reveal that Indian agriculture is
            sector accounting for 18% of india's Gross Demostic Product(GDP) and
            provide employment to nearly 50% of workers. Unfortunately despite
            being the main people in such industry ,Indian farmers are
            constantly subjected Harassment, Unemployment or lower payment of
            crops and such other things subjecting them into incur losses and
            face Poverty. India is the largest producer of wheat,rice,pulses and
            spices and has more scope for groth in agricultural sector. If
            farmers get an assured minimum support prices for their produces and
            also if the functioning in trade is made digital or online,or by
            eliminating middle person who is exchanging goods from farmers to
            factories or from factories to farmers. Then the financial state of
            farmers will be improved in agricultural fields is witnessed in some
            places, due to new laws and polices provided an important issues to
            discuss in schools on other social and political platforms.
          </p>
          <img  class="img2" src="images/farm3.jpg" alt="loading their harvest">
          <p>
            Indian farmers are second to none in production and productivity
            despite of the fact that millions are marginal and small farmers.
            They adopt improved agriculture technology as efficiently as farmers
            in developed countries. It is felt that with provision of timely and
            adequate inputs such as fertilizers, seeds, pesticides and by making
            available affordable agricultural credit /crop insurance, Indian
            farmers are going to ensure food and nutritional security to the
            Nation.

            Various reasons such as monsoon failure, climate change, high-debt
            burdens, Government policies, mental health, climate changes,
            interstate water disputes, water crisis, lack of awareness, lack of
            direct integration with market, distressed due to loans, Costs of
            Agricultural equipment, cost of chemicals and seeds, personal issues
            and family problems are among the reasons for farmers suicides in
            India The list includes farmers-cultivators and agricultural
            labourers. Seven states account for 87.5 per cent of total suicides
            in the farming sector in the country including Maharashtra,
            Karnataka, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh
            and Tamil Nadu. Maharashtra is the worst affected state. Ironically,
            Punjab, which benefited most from the Green Revolution, also
            presents a depressing picture of farmers suicides in India. Between
            1995-2015, 4,687 farmers suicides have been reported from Punjab of
            which 1334 from one Mansa district alone.

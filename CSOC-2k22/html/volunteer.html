          We talked about many steps that can be taken to prevent farmers
          suicide's but, those steps require large scale implementation and
          requires lot of capital investment. But as an induvidual what can you
          do?. There are lot of things that you can help in you local.If you are
          living in rural india or small towns you will easily know about your
          local farmers. Reach out to them find out problems that they are
          facing if possible try to help in your way like if they are facing
          financial problems try to give some financial advice and educate them
          to take loans from banks where they offer low intrest rate rather than
          the local lender.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the farmer you know is illiterate and does'nt know how to bargain
          with middlemen for right price for their crops then help them in
          educating about the present market rate they should get for their
          harvest , so that they can have their right to bargain.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some reports it also came to my notice that that lot of farmers
          commit suicide due to getting cheated by fake CHIT FUNDS.Try and warn
          them about high intrest promising chit funds, most of the time those
          type of chit funds will be a scam.
        </p>

        <p>
          Chronic illness are also play a vital role in pushing farmers to death
          bed.As you know illness only farmers does'nt get illness everybody
          gets them, but the difference is educated and urban communities have
          awareness of treating harmful dieseases, but rural india as of my
          knowledge many people does'nt care about them especialy poor farmers.
          so try educating them about harmful diesease and their effect and also
          helping them in getting benifits from many of govt schemes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even today in rural areas lot of family practice dowry systems. And
          many farmers who are not capable of giving dowry end up hanging
          themselves. If you find about such practices happening in your local
          try informing Police about such acts, gradually this will help
          eradicating such practice in your local, so many lives could be saved.
